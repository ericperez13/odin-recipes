        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that tantalizes the taste buds with its layers of rich, savory goodness.
            To
            prepare this delectable recipe, start by layering al dente lasagna noodles in a deep baking dish. Next,
            create a
            sumptuous meat sauce by browning ground beef or pork with onions and garlic, then simmering it in a fragrant
            tomato sauce infused with herbs like basil, oregano, and a touch of red pepper flakes for a subtle kick. In
            a
            separate bowl, mix creamy ricotta cheese with beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, and finely chopped fresh
            parsley.
            Layer the lasagna with the meat sauce, noodles, and the ricotta mixture, creating a harmonious blend of
            textures
            and flavors. Top it off with a generous sprinkle of mozzarella cheese, which turns beautifully golden and
            bubbly
            during baking. Finally, bake until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is perfectly melted. The result is
            a
            mouthwatering masterpiece that's hearty, satisfying, and perfect for sharing with family and friends. Buon
            appetito!

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
            basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
            minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella
            cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
